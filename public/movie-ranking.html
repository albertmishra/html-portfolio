<h1>The Best Movies According to Vikas</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Namaste London</h3>
<p>
    This is my all time favorite. One of the few movies of Akshay Kumar's serious acting that mark some impact on me.
    The ever beautiful Katrina Kaif played the character Jass who is someone born and brought up in London.
    The story line up is good and focusses on how the people of a country even after leaving their country, are still tied to it when it comes to customs and marriages.

<h3>Swadesh</h3>
<p>
    Sharukh Khan playing as Mohan Bhargav. The movie draws attention towards the brain drain issue that we face.
    How the well trained people are need of any country. Some of the most beautiful aspects of the film are the locations.
    How people hand fully take and welcome people coming from abroad.
    The first time usage of internet and many more.

<h3>Tare Zameen Par</h3>
<p>
    Amir Khan, the perfect teacher, understands the problem faced by the student. Instead of forcing students into studies, he focusses on solving problems of the child.
    Darsheel Safari's acting is awesome.
